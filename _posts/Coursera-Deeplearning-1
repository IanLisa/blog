list of papers based on some of the work Geoffrey Hinton that he mentioned in his interview

-->most relevant to this course are those papers that focus on applications.
I would start with the Dropout paper (Srivastava et al. (2014)), after learning about backpropagation I think it is a great paper 
to take a look at. It has a discussion on backprop, shows examples of structuring machine learning experiments and the main 
point of the paper is addressing variance in machine learning models which is a major topic in the next course of this 
specialisation.
After that I would consider looking at Phone Recognition using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (Mohamed and Hinton (2010)). 
It provides a description of RBMs and provides another example of setting up machine learning experiments.
